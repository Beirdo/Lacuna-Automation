This is a simple client implementation for Lacuna Expanse (https://lacunaexpanse.com/),
with some ability to automate building on your planets.

This client is not as complete as Games::Lacuna::Client,
but it does make reasonable attempts to handle cache invalidation properly.

The main scripts of interest are:

show_planet [--body Name]
  Give a text representation of the status of one of your planets.

build_queue [--body Name] [--queue Name]
  Try to build / upgrade something on one of your planets,
  based on a queue of desired builds.
  This is intended to be run from cron, once per minute, for each planet.
  Look at the sample build queue template for an idea of how to format the build queue.

project.pl [--body Name]
  Try to predict resource levels and completion times for a sequence of builds.
  Only supports buildings you already have at least one copy of on the planet,
  due to limitations of the API.

get_json [element/path [file ...]]
  This pretty-prints json, optionally selecting just a portion of the input
  (picking hash elements per the supplied path).
  Input is from stdin, or files named after the element path.
